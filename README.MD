# Paradise Wiki Docs

This repo is for proposing changes to protected wiki pages.

Edits can be made here by anyone, but a Head of Staff must approve them before merge. Merges will automatically reflect on the wiki.

## Expectations

1. You are expected to test your edits on a blank/testing wiki page first before making an edit.
2. Changes are to be atleast discussed before being made offhand.

## Notes

- As per the wiki, everything on here is under GNU Free Documentation License. See `LICENSE.MD`.
- Theres a VSCode extension, `jasew.mediawiki`, which provides syntax for `.wiki` files. I recommend it for editing.
